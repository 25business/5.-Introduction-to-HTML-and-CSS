                <p><strong>Lauren Monroe</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; singer, songwriter, and healing artist &mdash; will release her new single,&nbsp;<strong>"Kiss Me Now"</strong>, on March 18. The single's arrival will be celebrated with select, intimate performances where&nbsp;<strong>Monroe</strong>&nbsp;will be joined by her husband and collaborator, Rock And Roll Hall Of Famer and&nbsp;<strong>DEF LEPPARD</strong>&nbsp;drummer&nbsp;<strong>Rick Allen</strong>. At the shows, audience members will be able to view two special works of art created by the couple, which will be auctioned online to benefit&nbsp;<strong>Raven Drum Foundation</strong>. Founded by&nbsp;<strong>Allen</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Monroe</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Raven Drum Foundation</strong>'s mission is to serve, educate, and empower veterans dealing with PTSD and combat trauma, people in crisis, and other at-risk populations.</p>
<p>Upcoming shows:</p>
<p>March 21 - New York, NY @ The Loft at City Winery<br />March 22 - Philadelphia, PA @ The Lounge at World Cafe Live<br />March 24 - Washington, D.C. @ The Loft at City Winery</p>
<p>Produced by the legendary&nbsp;<strong>Jim Scott</strong>&nbsp;and featuring&nbsp;<strong>Steve Ferrone</strong>&nbsp;(drummer of&nbsp;<strong>TOM PETTY &amp; THE HEARTBREAKERS</strong>),&nbsp;<strong>"Kiss Me Now"</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>Monroe</strong>'s first release of 2022 and follows her second solo album, 2021's&nbsp;<strong>"Under The Wolf Moon"</strong>. Bassist&nbsp;<strong>Bob Glaub</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>Jackson Browne</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Linda Ronstadt</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Bonnie Raitt</strong>), guitarist and back-up vocalist&nbsp;<strong>Brian Whelan</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>Jim Lauderdale</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Chris Shiftlett</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Dwight Yoakam</strong>), keyboardist&nbsp;<strong>John Ginty</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>THE DIXIE CHICKS</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>THE ALLMAN BETTS BAND</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>CITIZEN COPE</strong>), and pedal steel guitarist&nbsp;<strong>Doug Pettibone</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>John Mayer</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Tracy Chapman</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Norah Jones</strong>) also appear on the track.&nbsp;<strong>Scott</strong>&nbsp;describes&nbsp;<strong>"Kiss Me Now"</strong>&nbsp;as "California country," and&nbsp;<strong>Monroe</strong>&nbsp;explains it as "a reminder of the impermanence of life &mdash; a reminder to be grateful for who we have and the journey we have taken with loved ones." She continues, "It's about being happy and free, having fun but remembering it all ends one day. The pandemic challenged our ability to celebrate just being with people, and this song reminds us to celebrate the moments we do spend together."</p>
<p>The single's release and the subsequent performances coincide with National Complementary Therapy Week, March 20 &ndash; 27, in&nbsp;<strong>Allen</strong>'s native U.K. and throughout the United States. Through performance, storytelling, and art,&nbsp;<strong>Monroe</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Allen</strong>&nbsp;create an intimate experience for their audiences, showing them how music can impact healing and growth. The shows dovetail with the mission of&nbsp;<strong>Raven Drum Foundation</strong>, which promotes wellness through complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) like music and drumming.</p>
<p><strong>Raven Drum Foundation</strong>&nbsp;will be partnering with local veteran service organizations in each city to nominate area veterans to attend the shows free of charge. Supporters will have the option to purchase a seat for a veteran by visiting sponsoravet.givesmart.com and&nbsp;<strong>Raven Drum</strong>&nbsp;will fill the donated seat. In addition, two very special pieces of Allen and Monroe's collaborative, mixed media art works &mdash; one of which was the basis for the&nbsp;<strong>"Kiss Me Now"</strong>&nbsp;cover art &mdash; will be on display at the shows and available online via a silent auction. Proceeds will directly benefit&nbsp;<strong>Raven Drum</strong>'s upcoming grant cycle and the Veterans Multi Service Center in Philadelphia, in partnership with&nbsp;<strong>"The John DeBella Show"</strong>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<strong>102.9 WMGK-FM</strong>.</p>
<p>The foundation has already aided more than 20,000 veterans and 25,000 total people as they've explored and expanded on 15 methods of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) for healing trauma, published more than 400 educational and healing articles and resources, provided 22 retreats and workshops for Veterans, and enabled and funded 15 other nonprofits to work with veterans. On Veterans Day 2021, they launched an online auction called 12 Drummers Drumming, working in conjunction with a collection of music's most influential drummers. The group supported the effort by participating in multiple podcasts, donating signed items and personal&nbsp;<strong>Zoom</strong>&nbsp;calls, and a follow-up&nbsp;<strong>Zoom</strong>&nbsp;with donors. Participants included:&nbsp;<strong>Joey Kramer</strong>&nbsp;(AEROSMITH),&nbsp;<strong>Shannon Larkin</strong>&nbsp;(GODSMACK),&nbsp;<strong>Chad Smith</strong>&nbsp;(RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS),&nbsp;<strong>Sheila E.</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Cindy Blackman Santana</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Zac Hanson</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Duane Trucks</strong>&nbsp;(WIDESPREAD PANIC),&nbsp;<strong>Steve Smith</strong>&nbsp;(JOURNEY),&nbsp;<strong>Todd Sucherman</strong>&nbsp;(STYX),&nbsp;<strong>Danny Seraphine</strong>&nbsp;(CHICAGO),&nbsp;<strong>Brad Wilk</strong>&nbsp;(RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE),&nbsp;<strong>Matt Sorum</strong>&nbsp;(GUNS N ROSES, THE CULT, VELVET REVOLVER),&nbsp;<strong>Kenny Aronoff</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Jim Keltner</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Ringo Starr</strong>&nbsp;(THE BEATLES),&nbsp;<strong>John Lum</strong>&nbsp;(ALLMAN BETTS BAND),&nbsp;<strong>Jason Bonham</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Gina Schock</strong>&nbsp;(THE GO-GO'S), and&nbsp;<strong>Carter Beauford</strong>&nbsp;(DAVE MATTHEWS BAND). Current donors to the foundation have the opportunity to win a signed drum from&nbsp;<strong>Ringo Starr</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Joey Kramer</strong>, a guitar signed by&nbsp;<strong>Bret Michaels</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>POISON</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Rick Alle</strong>n memorabilia. No purchase necessary to win.</p>
<p>Music and healing have always been a focal point in&nbsp;<strong>Monroe</strong>'s life. Their influence has naturally carried into her songwriting, her support of&nbsp;<strong>Raven Drum Foundation</strong>, and her work helping people and communities in crisis.&nbsp;<strong>Monroe</strong>&nbsp;says, "To me, music is a heart-based experience. Through music, I lead people to more deeply connect to themselves and others. It's not just about listening. It's about feeling and connecting."</p>

                <h1>SHINEDOWN Releases 'Planet Zero' Music Video</h1>
                <div class="image_center">
                    <img src="./images/shinedownbandjan2022.webp" />
                </div>
                <p><strong>SHINEDOWN</strong>&nbsp;has released a thought-provoking and cinematic music video for its new single,&nbsp;<strong>"Planet Zero"</strong>. The clip arrives as&nbsp;<strong>"Planet Zero"</strong>&nbsp;hits No. 1 on the&nbsp;<strong>Billboard</strong>&nbsp;Mainstream Rock Airplay chart this week.</p>
<p>The explosive single, the title track from the band's seventh studio album, out April 22 via&nbsp;<strong>Atlantic Records</strong>, is&nbsp;<strong>SHINEDOWN</strong>'s 17th No. 1 and sixth consecutive chart-topper, breaking a new record for the most No. 1s in the 40-year history of the chart.</p>
<p>Directed by&nbsp;<strong>Charles De Meyer</strong>, the video brings to life a glimpse of a dystopian future (complete with a menacing A.I. character named&nbsp;<strong>Cyren</strong>&nbsp;from the album&rsquo;s interludes who we hear at the end of the music video) that warns of the dangerous dehumanizing consequences of cancel culture run rampant.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;<strong>"Planet Zero"</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>SHINEDOWN</strong>&nbsp;is serving up an incisive look at some of society&rsquo;s most critical issues, including the increasingly toxic division among those of differing ideologies, the need for honesty in our public discourse, and the corrosive effects of social media and cancel culture on mental health and humanity. The&nbsp;<strong>"Planet Zero"</strong>&nbsp;single rings the alarm with a cautionary warning that if we shut each other down, we risk losing empathy, respect for one another, and our ability to communicate and unify in a way that leads to actual progress and understanding.</p>
<p><strong>SHINEDOWN</strong>&nbsp;singer&nbsp;<strong>Brent Smith</strong>&nbsp;said: "We wanted the first visual of&nbsp;<strong>'Planet Zero'</strong>&nbsp;to be unlike anything we have done previously. We chose to work with visionary director&nbsp;<strong>Charles De Meyer</strong>. We did not want a traditional music video feel &mdash; we wanted avant-garde, thought-provoking and surreal. Make no mistake, there is a message in the visual, a warning of what is to come, if society does not wake up, and demand the truth be told. Welcome to PLANET ZERO&hellip;"</p>
<p>Over the last two decades,&nbsp;<strong>SHINEDOWN</strong>&nbsp;has cemented its status as one of the most vital and forward-thinking powerhouses in modern rock. Their most ambitious and masterfully realized work to date,&nbsp;<strong>"Planet Zero"</strong>&nbsp;is a high-concept, ultra-vivid, viscerally charged saga. A critical yet optimistic look at the fractures and frays of a society that has undergone many challenges in recent years, the album is part social commentary and part in-depth exploration of the human psyche.</p>
<p>Produced by&nbsp;<strong>SHINEDOWN</strong>'s own&nbsp;<strong>Eric Bass</strong>&nbsp;(who also helmed the band's 2018 album,&nbsp;<strong>"Attention Attention"</strong>), and recorded at&nbsp;<strong>Bass</strong>'s newly built&nbsp;<strong>Big Animal Studio</strong>&nbsp;in South Carolina,&nbsp;<strong>"Planet Zero"</strong>&nbsp;matches its immersive world-building and takedown of authoritarianism with a deliberately unvarnished sound. The album is spliced with interludes featuring&nbsp;<strong>Cyren</strong>, an insidious and unsettling robot character that appears throughout the&nbsp;<strong>"Planet Zero"</strong>&nbsp;journey. While a raw ferocity fuels much of&nbsp;<strong>"Planet Zero"</strong>&nbsp;on tracks like&nbsp;<strong>"The Saints Of Violence"</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>"Innuendo"</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>"No Sleep Tonight"</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>"America Burning"</strong>, there is also hope, triumph, and reminders that we all need one another on songs like&nbsp;<strong>"Daylight"</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>"Dysfunctional You"</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>"A Symptom Of Being Human"</strong>. After all, it is the band&rsquo;s impassioned drive for unity that has long been at the heart of their creative output and deeply informed the making of&nbsp;<strong>"Planet Zero"</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>"Planet Zero"</strong>&nbsp;track listing:</p>
<p>01.&nbsp;<strong>2184</strong><br />02.&nbsp;<strong>No Sleep Tonight</strong><br />03.&nbsp;<strong>Planet Zero</strong><br />04.&nbsp;<strong>Welcome</strong><br />05.&nbsp;<strong>Dysfunctional You</strong><br />06.&nbsp;<strong>Dead Don't Die</strong><br />07.&nbsp;<strong>Standardized Experiences</strong><br />08.&nbsp;<strong>America Burning</strong><br />09.&nbsp;<strong>Do Not Panic</strong><br />10.&nbsp;<strong>A Symptom Of Being Human</strong><br />11.&nbsp;<strong>Hope</strong><br />12.&nbsp;<strong>A More Utopian Future</strong><br />13.&nbsp;<strong>Clueless And Dramatic</strong><br />14.&nbsp;<strong>Sure Is Fun</strong><br />15.&nbsp;<strong>Daylight</strong><br />16.&nbsp;<strong>This Is A Warning</strong><br />17.&nbsp;<strong>The Saints Of Violence And Innuendo</strong><br />18.&nbsp;<strong>Army Of The Underappreciated</strong><br />19.&nbsp;<strong>Delete</strong><br />20.&nbsp;<strong>What You Wanted</strong></p>
<p><strong>SHINEDOWN</strong>&nbsp;will kick off&nbsp;<strong>"The Revolution's Live"</strong>&nbsp;tour beginning April 1, propelled by the undeniable power of Smith's voice and their biggest stage production yet. Following this April and May run with special guests&nbsp;<strong>THE PRETTY RECKLESS</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>DIAMANTE</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>SHINEDOWN</strong>&nbsp;will head to Daytona Beach for&nbsp;<strong>Welcome To Rockville</strong>&nbsp;2022 where they'll headline Saturday, May 21 alongside&nbsp;<strong>GUNS N' ROSES</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>RISE AGAINST</strong>. In June,&nbsp;<strong>SHINEDOWN</strong>&nbsp;will head overseas for a European run featuring festival appearances at&nbsp;<strong>Rock Im Park</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Rock Am Ring</strong>&nbsp;in Germany,&nbsp;<strong>Download</strong>&nbsp;festival in the U.K. and&nbsp;<strong>Hellfest</strong>&nbsp;in France along with select shows with&nbsp;<strong>IRON MAIDEN</strong>. The band will then embark on a run of Canadian dates beginning in July with support from&nbsp;<strong>POP EVIL</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>AYRON JONES</strong>.</p>
